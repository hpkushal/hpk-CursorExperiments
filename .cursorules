# Kushal HP Portfolio - Project Style Guide

## Writing Style Rules

### 1. No Em Dashes (—)
**NEVER use em dashes (—) in any content.**

Instead, use these alternatives:
- Use a colon `:` for introducing explanations or lists
- Use a comma `,` for light pauses
- Use a period `.` to break into separate sentences
- Use parentheses `()` for asides or clarifications
- Use a hyphen `-` for compound modifiers or simple separators

**Examples:**
- ❌ "The results were clear—we needed to pivot"
- ✅ "The results were clear: we needed to pivot"
- ✅ "The results were clear. We needed to pivot"

- ❌ "AI tools—like ChatGPT and Claude—are transforming PM work"
- ✅ "AI tools (like ChatGPT and Claude) are transforming PM work"
- ✅ "AI tools, like ChatGPT and Claude, are transforming PM work"

### 2. First-Person Voice
Articles should be written from Kushal's first-person perspective:
- Use "I", "my", "I've learned", etc.
- Share personal experiences and anecdotes
- Make the content feel authentic and relatable

### 3. Natural Flow
- Break complex ideas into digestible paragraphs
- Use conversational language
- Add personal examples where relevant
- Include visual elements (SVG graphics, charts) to break up text

## Code Style

### React/TypeScript
- Use functional components with TypeScript
- SVG components should be inline for custom graphics
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### CSS/Styling
- Use styled-components patterns consistent with the project
- Dark theme with accent colors
- Responsive design considerations

## Content Structure for Articles

1. **Opening**: Personal hook or relatable scenario
2. **Context**: Why this matters, your journey
3. **Core Content**: Frameworks, insights, examples
4. **Visuals**: Charts, diagrams, or graphics where helpful
5. **Practical Application**: Real examples, templates
6. **Closing**: Key takeaways, call to action
