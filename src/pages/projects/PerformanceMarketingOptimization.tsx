            <strong>Resulta</strong> was running campaigns across multiple channels but struggling with accurate measurement. Only 35% of conversions were attributed to marketing, leaving most revenue impact invisible.
          </p>
          <p>
            With 5 brands, different customer journeys, and varying attribution windows, traditional measurement approaches weren't working. We needed sophisticated attribution and optimization for our multi-touch, multi-brand ecosystem.

          <p>
            I identified critical gaps in our marketing measurement:
          </p>
          
          <h3>Poor Attribution Visibility</h3>
          <p>
            Only 35% of conversions attributed to marketing. The majority of revenue impact was invisible. We couldn't identify which campaigns actually drove results.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Inefficient Budget Allocation</h3>
          <p>
            Without accurate data, budgets were allocated on incomplete information. High performers were underfunded. Low performers kept receiving budget.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Siloed Channels</h3>
          <p>
            Each channel operated in isolation. No visibility into cross-channel journeys. Missed opportunities for channel synergy.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Manual Reporting Burden</h3>
          <p>
            15-20 hours/week spent compiling data from multiple platforms. Delayed optimization decisions. Data was outdated by the time we acted.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Inconsistent Data</h3>
          <p>
            Different platforms used different attribution models and definitions. Impossible to create unified views. Discrepancies undermined confidence.
          </p>
