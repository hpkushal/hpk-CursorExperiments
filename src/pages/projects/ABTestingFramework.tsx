          <p>
            <strong>Resulta's 5-brand portfolio</strong> was experiencing inconsistent conversion performance. Traffic was growing, but conversion rates varied wildly between brands. Decision-making was based on assumptions rather than validated insights.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each brand had different user journeys and goals, so a one-size-fits-all approach wouldn't work. I needed to create standardized testing methodologies that could adapt to different contexts while enabling cross-brand learning.

      content: (
        <div>
          <p>
            I identified several critical issues limiting our optimization potential:
          </p>
          
          <h3>Assumption-Based Decisions</h3>
          <p>
            Most changes were based on best practices or opinions rather than data. We were essentially guessing, leading to inconsistent results.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Inconsistent Testing</h3>
          <p>
            Different brands used different tools (or none at all). No way to compare results or share learnings. Some tests ran without statistical rigor.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Low Testing Velocity</h3>
          <p>
            Manual setup and analysis limited us to 2-3 tests per month across all brands. Too slow to iterate or respond to market changes.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Weak Statistical Confidence</h3>
          <p>
            Tests often concluded without reaching significance. 65% confidence levels made it hard to trust recommendations.
          </p>
          
          <h3>No Knowledge Sharing</h3>
          <p>
            Successful tests in one brand weren't applied to others. We kept solving the same problems repeatedly.
          </p>

        <div>
          <p>
            I designed a comprehensive A/B testing framework with standardized processes and multi-platform capabilities.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Multi-Platform Architecture</h3>
          <p>
            Selected <strong>Optimizely</strong> for complex multivariate tests, <strong>Google Optimize</strong> for rapid website changes, and <strong>VWO</strong> for personalization. Right tool for each use case.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Standardized Methodology</h3>
          <p>
            Developed protocols for hypothesis formation, sample size calculations, test duration, and result interpretation. Consistent, reliable results across all brands.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Automated Test Management</h3>
          <p>
            Built workflows that auto-calculate sample sizes, monitor progress, and alert when tests reach significance. Reduced manual effort while maintaining rigor.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Advanced Segmentation</h3>
          <p>
            Enabled targeted testing by user segment, traffic source, and behavior. Discovered segment-specific opportunities that broad tests would miss.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Cross-Brand Learning Repository</h3>
          <p>
            Created a centralized knowledge base capturing insights and successful variations. Rapid application of proven strategies across brands.

            The framework delivered measurable results within the first 12 months:
          </p>
          
          <h3>38% User Activation</h3>
          <p>
            Activation rates improved from 28% to 38% through systematic testing of onboarding flows and feature introductions.
          </p>
          
          <h3>22% Free-to-Paid Conversion</h3>
          <p>
            Conversion jumped from 12% to 22% via targeted testing of pricing pages, trial experiences, and checkout funnels.
          </p>
          
          <h3>3x Testing Velocity</h3>
          <p>
            Went from 2-3 tests per month to 8-10 tests. Faster iteration enabled rapid response to market changes and user feedback.
          </p>
          
          <h3>85%+ Statistical Confidence</h3>
          <p>
            All decisions now backed by proper statistical rigor. No more implementing changes based on inconclusive results.
          </p>
          
          <h3>$500K+ Additional Revenue</h3>
          <p>
            Combined conversion improvements generated over $500K in additional annual revenue, directly attributable to specific optimizations.
          </p>
          
          <h3>60% Faster Cross-Brand Optimization</h3>
          <p>
            Successful tests rapidly applied across other brands. Learning repository prevented duplicate effort and accelerated wins.
