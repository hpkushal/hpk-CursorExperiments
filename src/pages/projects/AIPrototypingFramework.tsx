            <strong>Resulta</strong> is a digital agency specializing in product strategy and development for high-growth startups and enterprise clients. Our portfolio spans fintech, healthcare, and e-commerce verticals.
          </p>
          <p>
            The competitive landscape was shifting rapidly. Clients expected faster delivery without compromising quality. Our traditional 12-week cycles were becoming a liability in an era where competitors promised 4-6 week turnarounds.

      title: "The Challenge",
      content: (
        <div>
          <p>
            I identified several critical bottlenecks during my initial workflow analysis:
          </p>
          
          <h3>Lengthy Development Cycles</h3>
          <p>
            12-week average cycles (16 weeks for enterprise). Breakdown: 3 weeks requirements, 4 weeks design, 3 weeks dev, 2 weeks testing.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Painful Design-to-Dev Handoffs</h3>
          <p>
            Developers spent 5-7 days interpreting Figma specs and setting up boilerplate. This manual process caused inconsistencies and revision loops.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Limited Iteration Capacity</h3>
          <p>
            Only 1-2 major iterations per month. Clients were frustrated when market feedback required quick pivots.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Resource Inefficiency</h3>
          <p>
            Senior developers spent 40% of time on repetitive setup. Designers created variations manually instead of innovating.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            I designed a comprehensive AI-powered prototyping framework integrating cutting-edge tools with strategic process optimization.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Cursor AI for Code Generation</h3>
          <p>
            Implemented Cursor AI to auto-generate production-ready React components from design specs. Developers review and refine instead of building from scratch.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Figma AI for Design Automation</h3>
          <p>
            Integrated Figma AI to auto-generate responsive breakpoints, state variations, and accessibility-compliant versions from base components.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Automated Documentation</h3>
          <p>
            Technical specs, API docs, and component libraries generate automatically as code is written. This eliminated the 5-7 day documentation bottleneck.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Built-in Quality Assurance</h3>
          <p>
            Automated testing setup, accessibility checks, and performance optimization baked into the pipeline.

            The framework delivered transformational results within the first quarter of full adoption:
          </p>
          
          <h3>50% Faster Delivery</h3>
          <p>
            Development cycles dropped from 12 weeks to 6 weeks. Enterprise projects went from 16 weeks to 8 weeks, fundamentally changing our competitive positioning.
          </p>
          
          <h3>6x Iteration Velocity</h3>
          <p>
            Iteration capacity increased from 1-2 to 6-8 cycles per month. Faster feedback loops led to better product-market fit for clients.
          </p>
          
          <h3>50% Cost Reduction</h3>
          <p>
            Average project costs dropped from $150K to $75K due to automation and faster delivery. This enabled competitive pricing and higher margins.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Client Retention Jump</h3>
          <p>
            Client satisfaction scores increased 40%. Retention rate improved from 75% to 92%. Secured 3 major contracts worth $2M+ attributed directly to our new capabilities.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Team Satisfaction</h3>
          <p>
            Engineers and designers reported higher job satisfaction. They now focus on creative problem-solving instead of boilerplate work. Senior dev productivity increased by 60%.
