            I identified critical issues impacting customer retention:
          </p>
          
          <h3>Workflow Disruptions</h3>
          <p>
            Customers manually exported and imported data between systems. Time-consuming bottlenecks. Human error risks. Particularly painful for enterprise customers with complex workflows.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Data Silos</h3>
          <p>
            Customer data fragmented across systems. Inconsistencies and duplicates. Incomplete visibility into customer relationships. Hindered decision-making.
          </p>
          
          <h3>150+ Support Tickets Monthly</h3>
          <p>
            Integration issues consumed customer success resources. Frustrated customers expected seamless connectivity with existing tools.
          </p>
          
          <h3>30% of Churn Cited Integrations</h3>
          <p>
            Exit interviews revealed workflow disruptions as a primary reason for not renewing. Integration gaps directly impacted retention.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Competitive Disadvantage</h3>
          <p>
            Lost deals to competitors with better integration ecosystems. Prospects frequently chose platforms with more workflow compatibility.
          </p>

          <h3>Strategic Prioritization</h3>
          <p>
            Ranked integrations by customer impact and technical feasibility. CRM integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot) came first, covering 60% of requests. Created roadmap delivering maximum benefit in shortest time.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Collaborative API Design</h3>
          <p>
            Worked with engineering to define specifications balancing customer needs with technical constraints. Documented data models, authentication, rate limits, and error handling.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Customer-Centric Architecture</h3>
          <p>
            Prioritized ease of implementation. RESTful APIs with intuitive endpoints. Clear documentation so customer teams could implement quickly.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Rigorous Testing</h3>
          <p>
            Established testing framework with functional, performance, and real-world scenario validation. Pilot program with 5 enterprise customers before general release.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Developer Experience Focus</h3>
          <p>
            Created comprehensive documentation, code samples, and implementation guides. Minimized time-to-integration and support requirements.
