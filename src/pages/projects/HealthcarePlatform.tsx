          <p>
            <strong>Healthcare professionals</strong> needed a centralized platform for educational resources, best practice sharing, and patient education materials. Existing platforms were either too academic for practical use or too simplified for professional credibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            The challenge: create accessible yet comprehensive resources that busy clinicians could quickly consume. The platform needed to serve physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals with varying experience levels and technological comfort.

          <p>
            I identified critical gaps in existing healthcare education resources:
          </p>
          
          <h3>Fragmented Resources</h3>
          <p>
            Content scattered across journals, institutional sites, and multiple platforms. Professionals wasted time searching instead of learning.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Poor Accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            Existing platforms weren't designed for users with disabilities. Only 40% accessibility compliance. Complex interfaces hindered quick information retrieval.
          </p>
          
          <h3>No Patient-Friendly Materials</h3>
          <p>
            Professionals needed materials that were medically accurate but patient-readable. Most resources were either too complex or too simplified.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Limited Collaboration</h3>
          <p>
            No centralized place for professionals to share cases, discuss best practices, or learn from peers across specialties.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Mobile Gaps</h3>
          <p>
            Existing platforms weren't optimized for clinical workflows. Professionals needed access during rounds and patient interactions.
