            I identified critical issues limiting our marketing effectiveness:
          </p>
          
          <h3>Fragmented Customer Journeys</h3>
          <p>
            Touchpoints managed manually across different systems. Leads fell through cracks between acquisition and conversion. Significant revenue loss.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Manual Process Bottlenecks</h3>
          <p>
            60% of activities required manual intervention. Teams spent time on admin instead of strategy. Couldn't scale customer acquisition.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Inconsistent Brand Experience</h3>
          <p>
            Different tools across brands. Disconnected customer experiences. No cross-brand opportunities captured.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Limited Personalization</h3>
          <p>
            Basic segmentation only. No behavior-based personalization. Lower engagement and conversion rates.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Poor Lead Nurturing</h3>
          <p>
            Inconsistent follow-up timing. High-value prospects neglected. Untimely or inappropriate communications.
          </p>
        </div>
